		I chose to create a personal website because I want people to get know me. The site basically tells who am I and what I like to do. I  first began working on this site just for a few weeks during the Summer which was one of the first sites I've ever built. Just beginning to learn how to code I became highly intrested pretty quickly. Not to mention I became good too in a short amount of time. I spent most of days during Summer practicing code to become better. Some big challenges I faced were really petty tedious challenges. There were a few times when I would forget the closing tag for a tag and it would mess up my entire code. It could take me up to 15 minutes skimming the code, debugging it, just to find a simple error. This definitely taught me a lesson to take my time making sure everything is great for publishing because paste makes waste. Whenever I start something new I set a goal to complete my task in a certain amount of time. Considering myself as a programmer I've code multiple projects and plan to continue to do so that I can become even better and achieve even more.
